# Task List in React.js
Hi! This project is still work in progress while I learn basics of React.js
I've created it as a part of entry level online course for Frontend developers that I'm participating in.
This project is in polish.

Thank You for stopping by.
## Demo

I will provide a link to GitHub Pages once I have a build. In the mean time feel free to the vanilla version in my repository:

https://github.com/bedicooper/taskList

https://bedicooper.github.io/taskList/

## Written in 

In this project I'm using *javascript* with *React* library, *grid* and *flex*.
## What's inside?
My task list is built on a simple form with one input and a submit button.

I've yet to implement button and form interactions.

List of records will apear beneth the form, each record with two buttons, one to mark task as done and one to delete the task form the list.

So far two task are hard-coded for testing purpuses.

### What's new?
I've rebuild document structure and styling using react.js.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
